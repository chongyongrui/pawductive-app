Pawductive is an android productivity application that encourages users to stay focused while carrying out tasks.
This works by having a timer feature that only counts down as long as users do not exit the app.
Points will be earned as the timer counts down, allowing users to unlock achievements as more points are earned and their levels increased.
This data is stored online in a database, where the user can create their own account for free.
There are also other functions, such as a daily planner function built into the app that allows the user to plan out their day and let them create a focused time slot for each task they have.
A built-in notepad also allows users to fast and effectively take down and save notes on the app.
A community feature also allows users to track their progress against fellow users, creating a sense of competition.
There are also theme customisation features for users to personalise their experience.
